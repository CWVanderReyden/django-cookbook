### README.md for Cookbook - Django 1.4.2
# Based on cookbook app: 

[http://django-workshop.de](http://django-workshop.de)

I created this just to demonstrate what I can do:

Add recipes to your cookbook through superuser login.

Database backup with banana pancakes and hummus recipes: backup.json

Database import with 3 German recipes: import.json

Setup local_settings.py to hold local development environment settings for best practice.

De-coupled URLconf and Templates for best practice DRY.

Added staticfiles and HTML5 Boiler.
